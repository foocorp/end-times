<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>How do I listen to music?</h3>

<p>We don't offer any streamed music on this site.</p>

<p>At present, no. Historically, some musicians share their music with the
world with some <a href="https://creativecommons.org" target="_blank">Creative
  Commons</a> licenses and we supported streaming and downloading some of those
 songs. This is currently unavailable. If there's demand (let us know!) this may
  return someday.</p>

<h3>Can I import my listening habits from Last.fm, etc?</h3>

<p>This is something we hope to offer in the first few months of 2026. <a
href="https://github.com/kabniel/last2libre" target="_blank">Previous solutions
   exist but require command line experience</a>.</p>

<h3>Can I export my data?</h3>

<p>You can! We're working out the best format to deliver that in, but you can
request your data today by emailing support.</p>

<h3>Do you support any social media features?</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://libre.fm/user/mattl/scrobble/1733371909"
target="_blank">share a link showing any song you've listened to</a> the
Fediverse and Bluesky. You can also share and embed an image of your currently
playing songs. You'll find this on your profile when logged in and playing a
song, but it lives at <a href="https://libre.fm/user/mattl/now">/now</a> on your
  profile. I occasionally think about additional social media features but I'm
not   sure what else would be useful.</p>

<h3>I accidentally scrobbled something I want to get rid of...</h3>

<p>Any <a href="https://libre.fm/user/mattl/scrobble/1733371909"
target="_blank">individual scrobble</a> has a delete option at the bottom (if
it's your scrobble). Check your profile for links to your latest scrobbles.</p>

<h3>How do I change my username or password?</h3>

<p>Contact <a href="mailto:support@libre.fm">support@libre.fm</a>. I'll be
happy to help you in any way possible.</p>

<h3>Do you support...?</h3>

<p>If you can send scrobbles to us, yes. Particularly if you are doing things
on a cool/old/retro/vintage system...</p> <p>Any/all operating systems are
supported.</p>

<h3>You're blocking my VPN! Why?</h3>

<p>We don't block any VPNs. But we do block traffic from <strong>lots</strong>
 of web hosting companies. These are often used by bots and scrapers and they
send us lots and lots of traffic.</p> <p>In accordance with the <a href="/ai">AI
policy</a>, these things are blocked. We're   happy to help, and reach out to
support if you think we're blocking something we   shouldn't. Every page should
have an IP address or Cloudflare Ray ID at the   bottom. These are both useful
things to let us know. You can also check the IP   address yourself at <a
href="https://www.abuseipdb.com" target="_blank">AbuseIPDB</a> and see what's
going on.</p>

<p>Libre.fm is a   service for humans.</p>

<h3>Are you on Discord, Twitter, Facebook, Bluesky, Mastodon, MySpace?</h3>

<p>No. Not any more.</p>

<p>You will find mattl in #libre.fm on <a target="_blank"
href="https://libera.chat">libera.chat</a> or in #internet on <a target="_blank"
href="https://home.omg.lol/info/irc">omg.lol's IRC server</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that I cannot offer support beyond very casual guidance on IRC.
Support requests should be sent via email.</p>

<h3>What are some good songs to listen to?</h3>

<p>Anything you like of course... but, some songs I like include:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Am-BF7ObCI"
target="_blank">Birdhouse In Your Soul</a> by They Might Be Giants</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pANNkrWZ8_s" target="_blank">All
The Girls       Are Complicated</a> by Laura Cantrell</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1GxjzHm5us"
target="_blank">Blue       Monday</a> by New Order</li>

  <li>And really anything by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@welovepulp"
target="_blank">Pulp</a> or <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.youtube.com/@HalfManHalfBiscuitOfficial">Half Man Half
Biscuit</a>...</li>

</ul>

<p>But that's just <a href="/user/mattl">stuff I like</a>. You should listen to
  whatever you like, but you should really give Half Man Half Biscuit a listen
sometime.</p>

<h3>How do I delete my account?</h3>

<p>Edit your profile, scroll to the bottom and there's a way to delete your
account. We'll send you a confirmation email first.</p>
