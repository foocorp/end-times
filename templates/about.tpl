<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>How do I listen to music?</h3>

<p>We don't offer any streamed music on this site.</p>

<p>Historically, some musicians share their music with the world with some <a href="https://creativecommons.org" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> licenses and we supported streaming and downloading some of those songs. This is currently unavailable. If there's demand (let us know!) this may return someday.</p>

<h3>Can I import my listening habits from Last.fm, etc?</h3>

<p>This is something we hope to offer in the first few months of 2026. <a href="https://github.com/kabniel/last2libre" target="_blank">Previous solutions exist but require command line experience</a>.</p>

<h3>Can I export my data?</h3>

<p>You can! We're working out the best format to deliver that in, but you can request your data today by emailing support.</p>

<h3>Do you support any social media features?</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://libre.fm/user/mattl/scrobble/1733371909" target="_blank">share a link showing any song you've listened to</a> the Fediverse and Bluesky. You can also share and embed an image of your currently playing songs. You'll find this on your profile when logged in and playing a song, but it lives at <a href="https://libre.fm/user/mattl/now">/now</a> on your profile. I occasionally think about additional social media features but I'm not sure what else would be useful.</p>

<h3>I accidentally scrobbled something I want to get rid of...</h3>

<p>Any <a href="https://libre.fm/user/mattl/scrobble/1733371909" target="_blank">individual scrobble</a> has a delete option at the bottom (if it's your scrobble). Check your profile for links to your latest scrobbles.</p>

<h3>How do I change my username or password</h3>

<p>Contact <a href="mailto:support@libre.fm">support@libre.fm</a></p>

<h3>Are you on Discord/Twitter/Facebook/Bluesky/Mastodon/MySpace?</h3>

<p>No. You will find mattl in #libre.fm on <a target="_blank" href="https://libera.chat">libera.chat</a> or in #internet on <a target="_blank" href="https://home.omg.lol/info/irc">omg.lol's IRC server</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that I cannot offer support beyond very casual guidance on IRC. Support requests should be sent via email.</p>

<h3>What are some good songs to listen to</h3>

<p>Anything you like of course... but, some songs I like include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Am-BF7ObCI" target="_blank">Birdhouse In Your Soul</a> by They Might Be Giants</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pANNkrWZ8_s" target="_blank">All The Girls Are Complicated</a> by Laura Cantrell</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1GxjzHm5us" target="_blank">Blue Monday</a> by New Order</li>
<li>And really anything by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@welovepulp" target="_blank">Pulp</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@HalfManHalfBiscuitOfficial">Half Man Half Biscuit</a>...</li>
</ul>

<p>But that's just <a href="/user/mattl">stuff I like</a>. You should listen to whatever you like, but you should really give Half Man Half Biscuit a listen sometime.</p>

<h3>How do I delete my account?</h3>

<p>Edit your profile, scroll to the bottom and there's a way to delete your account. We'll send you a confirmation email first.</p>
