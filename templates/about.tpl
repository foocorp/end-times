<p class="text-center">Connect your music player to Libre.fm</p>

<p class="text-center">Every time you listen to a track, your computer (or phone, TV, etc) reports the song title, artist and album to Libre.fm. We put these on your profile.</p>

<p class="text-center">Depending on how you listen to music, <a href="https://wiki.libre.fm/Clients">we recommend Web Scrobbler and DeaDBeeF</a> for new users but there are dozens of Libre.fm compatible players.</p>

<summary>Frequently Asked Questions</summary>
<h3>How do I listen to music?</h3>

<p>Some musicians share their music with the world with some <a href="https://creativecommons.org" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> licenses. We'll have streaming and downloads of these songs shortly.</p>

<h3>Can I import my listening habits from Last.fm, etc?</h3>

<p>This is something we hope to offer in early 2025. Previous solutions exist but require command line experience.</p>

<h3>Can I export my data?</h3>

<p>You can! We're working out the best format to deliver that in, but you can request your data today.</p>

<h3>Do you support any social media features?</h3>

<p>You can share a link showing any song you've listened to the Fediverse and Bluesky. We're working on additional social media features.</p>
