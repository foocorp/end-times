          <h1>Time is running out.</h1>

          <p>The web is being destroyed from within by companies harvesting the creative work of others.</p>

          <blockquote>Most websites don't have second acts.<br />
          Not here. We do things differently here. </blockquote>

          <h2>This is Libre.fm's second act.</h2>

          <p>No AI. Ever.</p>

          <p>LLMs need not apply. Bots not welcome. Closed to crawlers.</p>

          <h3>Save the web before it's too late.</h3>

          <p>A creative workspace for creative humans.</p>
